To run my answer to Task 1, simply go to Task1.py and run the program. The PennAir 2024 App Static.png is in the directory, so Task1.py should find it automatically. The contoured image plot should show up in a separate window. I have also added a screenshot of the contoured image plot in the directory, and to this publicly visible [Google Drive link](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1FU77AWc6vcadLCE2v581Dq6dNyxXZBQq/view?usp=drive_link). 

To run my answer to Task 2, simply go to Task2.py and run the program. The PennAir 2024 App Dynamic.mp4 is in the directory, so Task2.py should find it automatically. It will save the video as output_video.mp4 in the directory, overwriting any previously saved output_video.mp4's. I had added my output_video.mp4 in the directory but GitHub didn't let me upload a 100MB+ file. So I uploaded it to this publicly visible [Google Drive link](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1WzrpGs_gY4ef89lSSR8APVyYfbuHUl-I/view?usp=drive_link) instead. You may need to use VLC media player to play the videos. VLC worked for me, but MacOS's QuickTime Player did not.
